# Introduction

The following examples and implementations have been developed to be presented at the Division of Trauma & Acute Care Surgery of the Loma Linda University Medical Center.

Eventhough these implementations are not intended to be an exhaustive review of data analytic tools for the clinical practice, they are presented as broad exmples of trends of implementations that can make significant impact in clinical medicine, research, administration, and health promotion.
